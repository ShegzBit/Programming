#Solution
#Pseudo code

*Pseudo code for an application that sums up the the input of a user till it hits a negative number*
Declare n and let n = 0
Declare a variable v
while (true):
    take user input and store it in v
    IF v is less than 0:
        end loop
    ELSE:
        add the value of v to the current value of n and store it in n
        print the new value of n
        continue
